## 0.1.5
1. Refactor device configuration system to support three distinct configuration levels:
   - **New**: Added `goldenTestDefaultDevices` for setting global default device(s)
   - **Improved**: `goldenTestSupportedDevices` now exclusively for multi-device testing
   - **Changed**: `supportedDevices` parameter is now nullable, enabling proper configuration hierarchy
   - **Enhanced**: Device selection logic now follows clear priority: per-test override > multi-device mode > global default
   - **Fixed**: Golden file paths now intelligently include device names only when testing multiple devices 
   
    This change makes device configuration more intuitive and eliminates the need to pass `supportMultipleDevices: true` just to use a globally-defined single device.
